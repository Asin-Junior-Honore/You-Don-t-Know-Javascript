# Old Project Revival: "You Don't Know Javascript"

This project is a revival of one of my older projects, built with HTML and SCSS. Although it's an older project, it's always interesting to revisit past work and see how it can be improved or repurposed.

## Description
"You Don't Know Javascript" is a simple webpage featuring information about a book series on learning JavaScript. The project includes a navigation bar, sections highlighting different aspects of the book series, and a footer promoting a free ebook offer.
